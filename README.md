# 🧠 Python Experiments & Utilities (todo)

A curated collection of **Python-based experiments, utilities, and learning projects**
covering networking, automation, web scraping, video processing, and system-level tasks.

This repository serves as a **learning playground** where different concepts are explored
through small, focused implementations rather than a single monolithic application.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

- Practice **core Python programming**
- Explore **real-world use cases** (networking, automation, scraping)
- Build reusable scripts and utilities
- Strengthen understanding of **system design and workflows**

This repo reflects **hands-on learning and experimentation**, not copy-paste tutorials.
